                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>My research is triggered by multi-disciplinary studies and spans across a number of inter-related areas. The driver for my research is the need to investigate applications of information systems on different domains. My research is strategically positioned within the GOODIES group (http://ie.cs.mdx.ac.uk/) led by Prof Juan Carlos Augusto (https://www.jcaugusto.com/). The Research Group on Development of Intelligent Environments aims to advance the scientific understanding of the challenges associated with developing Intelligent Environments. Since September 2019 my associates and I created an informal group that we view more like a ‘family of minds’ that acts as think tank. The creation of the MCIS ‘family’ was encouraged by the late Professor Miltiadis (Miltos) Petridis (https://professormiltospetridis.muchloved.com/); perhaps the M should stand for Miltos. This is known as the Management & Collaborative Information Systems (MCIS) with its work focused on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>information systems</li>
                    <li>collaborative technologies</li>
                    <li>project management</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The core of my research could be classified as models and investigations in the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), based on my BSc, MPhil and PhD in Computation. I am particularly interested on how Information Systems can facilitate team collaboration, communication and coordination. My early work focused on dynamic role allocation in software engineering teams, gradually shifting on key aspects of virtual teams and global software development and engineering. My mission is to introduce effective work models for virtual teams that can increase the effectiveness of remote work, outsourcing and offshoring.</p>
                <p>My interest in e-business models combined with human aspects of software engineering led to the design of e-systems that can be applied on business problems, in particular in the field of project management. I combined my MBA and PRINCE2 training and other project management methods and standards with my interest in the use of Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0 technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality (AR) and Data Analytics in project management. My mission is to improve the efficiency of project management activities with the use of advanced digital technologies.</p>
                <p>My studies in education, including PGCert, MA and the work portfolios for my two Teaching Fellowships further equipped my genuine interest towards education technologies, e-learning and the role of digital technology in educational contexts. My work spans from introducing bespoke pedagogic models for e-learning and blended learning to the enhancement of learning and teaching techniques with the use of digital technologies. I am particularly keen in reforming assessment with innovative practices such as Augmented Reality and use of wearable devices, and transforming the role of feedback with the use of video tagging, sensors, and gamification.</p>
                <p>The impact of my work is really significant, as more than 30 international institutions have adopted my contributions as part of externally funded projects. I am regularly invited to share my findings in invited talks, while I often receive requests to join international consortia for further research under various funding programmes. I am blessed to work with colleagues from a network of more than 100 Universities, NGOs, private firms and institutions helping me to share my good practice in different knowledge transfer opportunities.</p>
