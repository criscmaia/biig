                <h1>Teaching</h1>
                <p>I have a significant involvement in the departmentâ€™s teaching, as I lead several modules and deliver lectures, lab sessions, workshops and seminars. My teaching involves a number of modules that span across all years of undergraduate programmes. In the past I have taught in a wide range of subject areas both at undergraduate and post graduate levels. My level 4 teaching spans across the entire spectrum of Information Systems topics, covering a wider range of systems analysis techniques and design principles. My module provides the foundations of informatics for students in the BIS cluster. My level 5 teaching focuses on Management Information Systems, a core topic that is delivered across all programmes of the Business School. This enables me to be involved in cross-faculty teaching and become aware of different practices in curriculum design and delivery. This is a huge module with more than 500 students enrolled in Hendon, while another 300 students are enrolled in overseas sites. Finally, my level 6 teaching combines Strategic Information Systems and Project Management, delivered across several programmes in the Computer Science Department. My module is one of the most popular modules and frequently reaches 200 students as it is delivered in various sites including Dubai, Mauritius, Malta, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka and external UK sites. My teaching also involves the supervision of project students, where I offer the opportunity to undergraduate and post graduate students to work on my research ideas, while applying their skills obtained in their other modules. Finally, I am involved in the leadership of a number of apprenticeship modules delivered to our franchise at Abingdon and Witney College. </p>
