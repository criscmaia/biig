                <p>BIiG’s partnership with <a href="https://kissifer.gr/">Kissifer</a> means that its innovative Personal Effectiveness programme that was designed in the UK and has been delivered in a number of schools in North London is now available for the centre’s children. Through this partnership, BIiG is able to support Kissifer in creating a bespoke programme for developing a range of transferable skills, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leadership</li>
                    <li>Teamwork</li>
                    <li>Communication</li>
                    <li>Collaboration</li>
                    <li>Coordination</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The learning experience is adapted to meet the needs of early years education and sessions are designed to ensure that children remain engage and reap the benefits of the development activities without feeling overwhelmed. The delivery of each session is coordinated by BIiG but is supported by Kissifer’s staff, ensuring that children remain within their comfort zone in the centre’s familiar surroundings and trusted staff. BIiG adheres to a very strict framework of conduct as provided by Kissifer to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to safeguard children and ensure their well-being. Parents may opt-in for additional workshops and further support from BIiG by participating in workshops held outside the centre’s scheduled programme. </p>
