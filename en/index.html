                <p>The British Institute in Greece (BIiG) is the result of a fusion between a UK firm specialising in knowledge transfer and a Greek training provider. The fusion of their specialism areas gave birth to a new business that attempts to bridge the gap in the private education sector by bringing together entrepreneurial learning services, innovative education solutions and creative training practices.

                </p>

                <p>Early on, BIiG’s extensive network of academic and business partners, identified opportunities for international collaborations. It appears that BIiG is destined to become a hub of educational initiatives that will internationalise know how created in the UK through innovative knowledge transfer initiatives and a wide range of capacity building projects.

                                <p>The perfect storm triggered by Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, a prolonged crisis for national economies and the increased instability leading to international conflicts has brought a dramatic impact in the education sector. Since 2016 a thinktank of academics, professionals, and technologists focused on identifying the future directions of the sector, aligned to those priorities established from the shift to the fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0).
                                </p>
                                <p>BIiG prides itself as having Education 4.0 at the core oof its strategic plan for creating learning experiences that are fully aligned to the needs of industry sectors. Each learning activity is designed around specific learning outcomes used to assess the achievement of specific knowledge, competencies and transferable skills that are mapped to certain employability requirements.
                                </p>

                                <p>BIiG’s emphasis on Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity (EDI) means that it aims at providing opportunities to access high quality, affordable education by overcoming typical obstacles associated with traditional forms of academic programmes. BIiG invests in strategic partnerships with educational providers for the accreditation of its wide range of courses and synergies with training providers in need for its academic experience and professional expertise.

                                <p>This led to a unique provision of a new mode of hybrid learning that:

                                    </li>
                                    <li>enables academic programme unbundling and re-synthesis to create bespoke/contextualised courses, </li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>BIiG’s main challenge is to balance its strong foundations of UK education provision and ability to exploit digital technologies for developing ground-breaking learning models, with the educational pillars stemming from Greece’s tradition in didactics and pioneering pedagogic paradigms. BIiG’s team of experts are capable of contextualising their scholarly and intellectual competencies to fully align with learner needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>BIiG’s founders have a well-established network of partners in the UK, and Greece leading to endless opportunities for designing new courses and introducing learning activities from full academic degrees to brief training seminars. It’s links to both private and public sectors enable BIiG to participate in a wide range of projects such as developing training academies, undertaking the training of professionals, creating awareness opportunities for entire communities, adapting learning sessions to support the development of school pupils, and participating in project outputs including research and development tasks. BIiG’s expanding international network of partners, based on long-standing relationships of its staff with universities and business across the world, bring further opportunities for transnational educational collaborations.
