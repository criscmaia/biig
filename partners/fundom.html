                <p>BIiG’s partnership with <a href="https://fundom.gr/">FunDom</a> strategically places both organisations in the frontline of state-of-the-art development programmes geared towards children. BIiG’s innovative personal development programme is customised to take advantage of the impressive facilities offered by FunDom. The partnership led to the integration of personal development learning with recreational activities offering both children and their parents to learn, have fun, reflect and plan. The learning journey begins with learning activities for children under the observation of BIiG’s staff and the support from FunDom’s educators. BIiG instructors coordinate the assessment of each child and prepare the necessary evaluation reports. Parents are welcome to observe the sessions and are given the chance to reflect on their child’s experience. While children have the opportunity to play in FunDom’s wide range of facilities, parents can discuss with BIiG’s experts and even consider any options for further sessions and additional services (e.g. personalised sessions, private workshops, video recordings, one-to-one consultation). The themes covered include the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leadership</li>
                    <li>Teamwork
                    </li>
                    <li>Communication
                    </li>
                    <li>Collaboration</li>
                    <li>Coordination</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each theme includes a wide range of activities that are selected according to the requirements of each session. Sessions are designed for different competency levels, with tasks, activities and challenges mapped accordingly. </p>
