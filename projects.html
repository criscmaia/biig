                                <p>The perfect storm triggered by Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, a prolonged crisis for national economies and the increased instability leading to international conflicts has brought a dramatic impact in the education sector. Since 2016 a thinktank of academics, professionals, and technologists focused on the identifying the future directions of the sector, aligned to those priorities established from the shift to the fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0).
                                </p>
                                <p>BIiG prides itself as having Education 4.0 at the core oof its strategic plan for creating learning experiences that are fully aligned to the needs of industry sectors. Each learning activity is designed around specific learning outcomes used to assess the achievement of specific knowledge, competencies and transferable skills that are mapped to certain employability requirements.
                                </p>

                                <p>BIiG’s emphasis on Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity (EDI) means that it aims at providing opportunities to access high quality, affordable education by overcoming typical obstacles associated with traditional forms of academic programmes. BIiG invests in strategic partnerships with educational providers for the accreditation of its wide range of courses and synergies with training providers in need for its academic experience and professional expertise.
                                </p>
                                <p>This led to a unique provision of a new mode of hybrid learning that:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>supports learning delivery in traditional face-to-face, e-learning and blended learning modes,
                                    </li>
                                    <li>enables academic programme unbundling and re-synthesis to create bespoke/contextualised courses, </li>
                                    <li>encourages self-paced and flexible study modes, </li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>BIiG’s main challenge is to balance its strong foundations of UK education provision and ability to exploit digital technologies for developing ground-breaking learning models, with the educational pillars stemming from Greece’s tradition in didactics and pioneering pedagogic paradigms. BIiG’s team of experts are capable of contextualising their scholarly and intellectual competencies to fully align with learner needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>BIiG’s founders have a well-established network of partners in the UK, and Greece leading to endless opportunities for designing new courses and introducing learning activities from full academic degrees to brief training seminars.
