                <h1>Leadership</h1>
                <h2>Director of Programmes in the Computer Science Department</h2>

                <p>As one of the three DoPs of the department, my role is to ensure the quality of the provision in the Business Information Systems directorate. I am responsible to ensure that our programmes are delivered according to the University regulations and coordinate programme teams across a number of operations. I am responsible to discuss with programme teams any delivery issues and review programme structures and aspects such as teaching and assessment practices. I am also able to support the Head of Department in the implementation of the departmental strategy and the deployment of any faculty initiatives at departmental level. Part of my DoP role is to coordinate programmes in preparation for Assessment Boards (AB) and represent the directorate in Programme Progression Boards (PPB). I am also the chair of the Programme Voice Group (PVG) meetings, liaising with students and staff in order to ensure the smooth operation of all programmes. The DoP role also enables me to provide my input in the department’s strategic planning. In my DoP role I act both as a medium for departmental decisions to reach academic staff, but also as a decision-maker for a number of student issues that cannot be addressed at programme level.</p>

                <h2>Programme Leader of BSc Business Information Systems</h2>

                <p>As the PL for the BSc BIS programme I am responsible for the smooth delivery of the programme. I lead the programme team in delivering learning, teaching and assessment aspects of the programme according to the programme specification. I am responsible for producing the programme handbook and ensuring that the programme’s learning resources are in line with the institutional requirements. I am also responsible for the programme’s students and in particular their learning experience according to the institution’s benchmarks and the highest national standards. During the induction sessions of the welcome week, I introduce myself as my students’ best friends. I am their point of reference when it comes to programme-level issues, while at times I may need to intervene if requested by module leaders.</p>

                <h2>Programme Coordinator for Apprenticeships</h2>

                <p>I am also responsible for the coordination of our four Apprenticeship specialisms, which requires liaising with the other directors and the programme leaders of the corresponding academic programmes. I am also involved in the investigation of possible apprenticeship collaborations with industry partners, including the presentation of our apprenticeship specialisms.</p>

                <h2>Link Tutor</h2>

                <p>I support a number of our links offering a range of undergraduate and post-graduate programmes. These include the following:</p>
